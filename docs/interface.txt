Command line use:

- `maple build`: to build a local image from remote image

- `maple pour`: to pour image into a container to enable shell access and port forwarding, similar to `maple run` which does not provide shell access but execute commands supplied in Dockerfile's `RUN` statement

- `maple notebook`: launches the notebook server

-  `maple bash`: provides shell access to the container

- `maple execute --command="echo Hello World!"`: example to launch specific command inside the container

- `maple rinse`: this commands stops and deletes the local container, if you want to save the work run `maple commit` to save changes to local image before maple rinse.

- `maple clean`: deletes the local image, if you want to update remote image with changes to local image run `maple push <remote_image_name:tag>` before `maple clean`

- `maple remove`: deletes the instance of remote image on local machine, doing this means that `maple build` will have to perform the expensive task of pulling the remote image again if you decide to rebuild the local image.
